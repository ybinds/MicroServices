
=> When method is taking interface as a parameter that means that method is expecting interface implementation class object as parameter.

				public void m1 (Bank b ) {  // loosely coupled bcz we can pass any impl cls obj

				}

				public void m1(AxisBank b){ // tightly coupled bcz we have to pass only AxisBank obj

				}

=> When method is having Interface as a return type that means that method will return interface implementation object as return type

				public Bank  m2 ( ) { // loosely coupled bcz we can return any impl cls obj

				}

				public HdfcBank  m2 ( ) {  // tighthly coupled bcz only HdfcBank obj shud be returned

				}
