1. Why do we need Comparator or Comparable?
Ans: Arrays.sort cannot sort custom objects like Student, Employee etc., like it does with primitive types like int, double etc.,

2. What is the difference between Comparator and Comparable
Ans: Comparable is a functional interface that has one abstract method which is compareTo. In order to sort an array of custom objects
you can implement Comparable interface and override compareTo method in the class and then you can sort the array based on the property 
you used in compareTo method. For ex.

public int compareTo(Employee e){
	return thid.id - e.id;
}
